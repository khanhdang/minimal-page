# Student's Project

I am happy to have chances to work with some students in the past.
The followings are  projects by my students, not mine. I was helping with some sort of guidance.

## Class Project

### Class: Real-time Gaming System
Designing a small game on Artix7 (AC701) with dual-core Microblazes (one controls HDMI, one mangages/renders the game). The game is programed based on FreeRTOS.

Our students attended the SEACAS 2019 Hackathon and won the 1st prize. The project is to develop a prototype of “Magic Spoon” which can compensate for the vibration (shaking) of a Parkinson's patient’s hand. Instead of using conventional PID, our students developed a single-layer perceptron to control the servo motor. Database and Andriod app are also developed to provide the ability to diagnosis and proper treatment.

Our students participate in the IEEE CASS Student Design Competition which is organized as a part of ISCAS 2020 at Seville, Spain, and online due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
