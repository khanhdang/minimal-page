Hi! My name is Khanh N. Dang. I am currently an *Associate Professor* in the Division of Computer Engineering, Department of Computer
Science and Engineering,
[The University of Aizu](https://www.u-aizu.ac.jp/en/). I received my Ph.D. from University of
Aizu
and my M.Sc. from University of Paris XI (Paris-Saclay University since 2019). Prior to joining the
University
of Aizu's faculty,
I was a faculty member of Vietnam National University, Hanoi. I also worked at [Dolphin-IC](https://www.dolphin-ic.com/) in the past.

**Research Interests:** My research spans *VLSI design*, *thermal-awareness*,
*fault-tolerance* and *neuromorphic computing*. In
particular, I have a strong interest in building on the 3D Integrated Circuit based neuromorphic computing
architecture that is highly-reliable and scalable enough to be safely and responsibly deployed in the real
world.

For prospective GT undergraduate and graduate students, research topics (VLSI design, fault-tolerance or neuromorphic computing) are available; interested potential candidates please send me an email.  Partial financial supports for graduate students (equivalent to tuition fee) are
also possible.
