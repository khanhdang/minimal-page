# minimal-page

This is my website Jekyll template. The website can be written in pure HTML and css; however, I ported it to Jekyll for easier maintenance.
All layouts are in pure HTML with simple CSS.

[Demo](https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~khanh/).

Some features (or maybe not really features at all):
- No menu just for simplicity ("back-to-homepage" link is added to each page). However, the navigation is enabled and a menu can be added.
- Mobile friendly
- Lightweight (No Javascript, > 160 lines of CSS)
