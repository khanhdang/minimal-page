# minimal-page

This is my website Jekyll template. The website can be written in pure HTML and css; however, I ported it to Jekyll for easier maintenance.
All layouts are in pure HTML with simple CSS.

[Demo](https://khanhdang.github.io/minimal-page/).

Some features (or maybe not really features at all):
- No menu just for simplicity (a "back-to-homepage" link is added to each page). However, the navigation is enabled and a menu can be added.
- Mobile friendly with a menu button
- Lightweight (20 lines of Javascript for mobile menu and less than 250 lines of CSS) 

# Run

Jekyll and bundle need to be installed.
```
make run # to run the local website at 127.0.0.1:4000
make build # to build the _site folder
make clean # to clean up the repo
```
