# Research 

## Neuromorphic Computing
Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, we design neuromorphic computers/chips consisting of physical artificial neurons (made from silicon) to do computations of a mimic version of biological brains. Here, we focus on digital approach in combination with 3D Integrated Circuits and Network-on-Chip. Our system is designed on both hardware (Verilog HDL) and software model (Python). 

## Machine Learning/Optimization for Computer-Aided Design
We target to solve complicated problem of Computer-Aided Design using machine learning and optimization technique. Despite being decided by the designers, we aim to develop the platform to generate the design. Our main focus is  using Genetic Algorithm/Reinforcement Learning on thermal awareness and reliability.

## Undervolted/Near-Threshold Computing
Beside conventional computing, lowering the operating voltage to near the threshold can help significantly reduce the power consumption. However, lowering the operating voltage make the system more vulnerable to noise. In this research topic, we investigate on the impact of lowering the voltage on chip design and how to handle the noise.

## Fault-tolerant Computing
Devices after manufacture and during wareout can suffer permanent defects that affect the accuracy of the device. Another type of fault is transient one when alpha particles or noises cause fluctuations in the cells/transistor causing incorrect consequence. In this topic, we research on how to predict and tolerate the potential faults.
